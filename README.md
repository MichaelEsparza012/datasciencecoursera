# Abstract

The topic of of this paper addresses the requirements set forth to meet the objectives for the first assignment of the Coursera Data Science Course of Instruction (COI), presented by the staff of John Hopkins University. Previous work has been conducted in Data Science reporting by the author; however, the difference in this assignment as compared to others taken in Data Science is the emphasis on ensuring that one understands the principles presented in the first four weeks of the course. The deficiencies in most organizations became obvious in the beginning of the course; and upon introspection, the issue seems to be that organizations are focused on Data Reporting, which is descriptive, asks “What?”, looks backward and presents data without information and context. Fundamentally, the central take away is that Data Analysis, as executed by a Data Science Manager (DSM), aims to be prescriptive, forward looking, intends to ask “Why?” and provides data plus information which results in knowledge. The fundamental exercises in this first assignment did involve some research in the review of the scientific method and the key differences between Data Reporting and Data Analysis, and has been applied in answering the questions presented throughout the course. The primary point is that Data Science Management (DSM) is still in its nascent stages and these brief but important responses serve to contribute, in their own way, to the continued growth of the discipline of Data Science Management.

# Introduction

In the first four weeks of the course, the critical fundamentals of Data Science was presented, with accompanying lectures that served to clarify the key points being emphasized. Much of the information was presented well; but to the beginner being introduced to the art and science of Data Science Management (DSM) for the first time, there was requirement to research certain the terms on their own.  Thus, the overall makeup of the course was balanced beneficially for the student.  What follows are the requirements of the the first assignment: practical application of lessons learned and the fundamentals of the DSM’s Tool Box.  

# Objective 1 - Installation of R Studio

One the first directives was to install R, install R Studio, open R Studio and capture a screen shot, and submit the screen shot in one of the following formats: png, jpg, gif or pdf.  After the initial installation of R and R Studio, the following screen shot was taken and is submitted for review (please Figure 1, below).  Note: this screen shot has been submitted separately and is part of a short paper.  Any questions, or if any of my esteemed classmates wishes just th R Studio file, please let me know!  At your service.

# Objective 2 – Establishment of a Git Hub Account.

The second objective of the assignment was to establish a Git Hub Account and present the URL for the established account for review.  After navigating to the Hit Hub website, the account was established with name “MichaelEsparza012” and a URL established to access the new Git Hub account.  There are currently 4 repositories (“repos”) residing within the author’s account, which were established as a form of practice.  Please see Figure 2 for the screenshot of the established Git Hub account, as directed in the course project instructions.  The URL for the course project Git Hub account is: https://github.com/MichaelEsparza012.

# Objective 3 – Creation of a datasciencecoursera Repository within Git Hub.

To address the requirements of the assignment, the establishment of a repository (“repo”) labeled “datasciencecoursera”  was directed. The repo was created, and the URL to the Git Hub repo for datasciencecoursera is submitted in accordance with the assignment instructions.  The repo was to contain the text “This is the Mark Down File” and was to contain the label “Hello World.”  The screenshot of the final deliverable is shown below, Please see figure 3.  The URL is https://github.com/MichaelEsparza012/datasciencecoursera. 

# Objective 4 – Fork the datasciencecoursera Repo to Professor Leek.

For the fourth objective of the project, the instructions were to “fork” the datasciencecoursera repo to the following URL: https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing.  After some trial and error, the final result was achieved and the the datasciencecoursera repo was forked to the indicated URL from Michael Esparza 012. Please see figure 4 which shows the fork from the Michael Esparza to J.T. Leek.  The URL is: 
https://github.com/MichaelEsparza012/datasharing. 

# Conclusion

The first four weeks of the Data Science specialization were enlightening and challenging.  While it took some time to understand the “Fork" method of forwarding/sharing the datasciencecoursera repo, it was finally understood and executed.  As mentioned previously, the introduction the the specialization showed the stark contrast to Data Reporting, which is the status quo in most organizations, and Data Analysis, which is forward looking and tells a story with context.
